Greetings, Traveller.
We bid thou welcome to our station.
There are no facades; all are welcome.
Take respite and bask in the bulbous splendor of our collection, whose origins far precede thy reality.
And worry not; we know already of thy quest.
Yet first, we require thy assistance collecting one final orb.
Its force repels this mortal coil.
Should'st thou prove thy self worthy of our aid by replacing that orb to its proper shrine, we would fain assist thy crusade
