Heyy, welcome to Mary Jane’s Botanicals!
That’s me, that’s my name, hehe
We sell gardening supplies!
Huh? No, I haven’t seen any kids around here…
Have you checked upstairs?
I heard there’s another store called Jazz Cabbage up there that’s selling weed stuff...
Oh, right, there’s a bunch of tapes on the escalator!
Hey, if you help out some of my customers here… maybe I can help get rid of some of that tape for you?
