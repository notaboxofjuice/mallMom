Heyy, welcome to Mary Jane’s Botanicals! :0
That’s me, that’s my name, hehe ;3
We sell gardening supplies! <3
Huh? :0
No, I haven’t seen any kids around here… :\
Have you checked upstairs? :0
I heard there’s another store called Jazz Cabbage up there that’s selling weed stuff :x
Oh, right, there’s a bunch of tapes on the escalator :(
Hey, if you help out some of my customers here… maybe I can help get rid of some of that tape for you? ;)
